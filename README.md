I'm Neil! This is my AI project for the course 308-424 at McGill. It's
a co-operative halma agent, where there are two teams and four players;
the goal is to exchange pieces before the other team. You can build it
with the jar at,

https://code.google.com/p/mcgill-cs424-project-2014/source/browse/

It compiled and ran with javac 1.5.0. There is a Makefile in s110121860
for your pleasure.
